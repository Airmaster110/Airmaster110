      more of these beautiful waifus in order of meeting them.</h3>

    <h2>Waifus are a way a life. Without them I wouldn't be the cringey person I am today.</h2>

    <img src="Mizore.jpg" alt="Mizore.jpg" border="5">
    <h3> This was the first waifu I've ever had. Her name is Mizore. Isn't she beautful? She has a very important  place in my heart.
        She's the first person I've ever fallen in love with. We have moved on, and I've met better waifus since 
        then, but I could never forget her.</h3>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is one of my most favorite waifus ever.</h2>
    <img src="Taiga.jpg" alt="Taiga.jpg" border="5">
    <h3>This is Taiga Aisaka. Yes, I remember her whole name because she's just that amazing. Honestly, I'd choose her over anyone else
        in the world. She's just so perfect; I just love her so much. I could never move on from her.</h3>
    <hr>
    <h2>This waifu is also one of my most favorite waifus of all time. She's just so Amazing!!!! I mean, look at her!!!!!!!!</h2>

    <h3> Honestly I would just love her so much love. Just ugh!!!!!</h3>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is Kirino. She's so pretty. One of the best tsunderes I know. Eventhough she's in junior high and that she loves her
        brother, I still consider her to be one of my most favorite waifus. I love the look in her eye and that shark tooth she shows
      as she smirks.</h2>

    <img src="Kagome.jpg" alt="Kagome.jpg" border="5">
    <h3>This girl is Kagome. She may not have the looks like the other waifus do, but she is just everything that you would want in a real wife.
        She is funny, outgoing, sweet, and isn't afraid to speak her mind. If I had to pick a real wife, it would be her.</h3>

    <img src="Emilia.jpg" alt="Emilia.jpg" border="5">
    <h3>Emilia is amazing person, and I fall in love with her at first sight. She always puts herself before others and is really sweet. She's just amazing. For some reason, my friend Sammy is an idiot and
            thinks that Rem is better when she obviously isn't.</h3>
    <br>
    <img src="rem.jpg" alt="rem.jpg" border="5">
    <h3>This is Rem. Obivously Emilia is the best girl. No question about it. No matter what you do. Emilia is better. I am only including her because some of my friends (yes, I have friends) like her. Sammy, youre an idiot. Rem is obviously
             the best girl. No matter what you think. Emilia is obviously better.</h3>
